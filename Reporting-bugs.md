# Reporting bugs

Before reporting a bug, it is very important to read this:
* [I set some parameters in configuration file, but server ignores them](FAQ#i-set-some-parameters-in-configuration-file-but-server-ignores-them)

In this modification, I've already implemented everything I initially planned, so the likelihood of adding new mechanics is close to zero, and there's no point in suggesting them.

However, if you discover any issues or bugs in the existing mechanics, or if you encounter documentation errors, you can inform me in the following ways:
* Through GitHub Issues [here](https://github.com/ysaroka/InediaInfectedAI/issues) (registration on GitHub is required)
* By emailing me at: [inedia49@gmail.com](mailto:inedia49@gmail.com)

When writing a report, it is advisable to provide a test case (a set of actions) for reproducing the bug in the context of using "InediaInfectedAI" without any other mods, except for administration mods, with a mandatory server wipe. For example, what coordinates should I stand at on the Chernarus map, at what coordinates should I spawn zombies, and what should I do to reproduce the bug. If your server crashes or throws errors related to this mod, please provide the file or text of the latest server crash log `%DayZserverDir%/profiles/crash_*.log`. Also, if you think it's necessary, you can attach the configuration file.

### Update policy

Bugfix updates, if needed, will be released within a few days after the vanilla game updates, approximately once every three months.

In addition, there may be a few hotfix updates in the days following the main update, and everyone will be informed about them on Telegram and Discord with an @everyone mention.
